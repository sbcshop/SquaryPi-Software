SquaryPi is a square LCD display based on the RP2040, with a tiny and attractive 1.54-inch display module with 240x240 pixels resolution. It consist of on board SD Card slot for storing data you want to display, accelerometer, and three user buttons. It includes an inbuilt st7789 Driver and I2C Interface to reduce the number of IO pins required for interfacing LCD. This one is sure a powerful device with great versatility for applications.

### Working with SquaryPi
Follow the steps below to start working with our SquaryPi board:

* Step.1 - Ater Downloading and extracting the Zip file the current repository in your computer system, locate the ***Python_Package*** directory and open it.
* step.2 - Now, you will see two folder, one is of Examples and 2nd is of Library folder.
* step.3 - Open the python files contains in both folder in ***Thonny IDE***.
* step.4 - Now, connect your board (updated firmware) via USB to your computer and save the library file as it is in RP2040 of your squaryPi board. If are working first time with Thonny and python files ***Please see our other documentation for how to handle python files in details*** or you can just [click here](https://shop.sb-components.co.uk/blogs/posts/getting-started-with-python-micro-python) for guidance of using circuit python and micropython.
* step.5 - After saving liberary file, open one of our Examples provided in it and run in by pressing Run button in Thonny.

**Note:** We have provide two example codes of Micropython one is of Tilt indication along X and Y axis another one is of Auisition of Accelrometer data to SD card.
